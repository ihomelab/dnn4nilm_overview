# Review on Deep Neural Networks applied to Low-Frequency NILM 

This repo contains data and code that has been used for the publication
"Review on Deep Neural Networks applied to Low-Frequency NILM" submitted @ MDPI
Energies. (The full reference should (hopefully) be added in close future.) 

This work is a considerable extension of the presentation "DNN for NILM on low
frequency Data" that has been done at the NILM workshop 2019. You can find the
corresponding presentation

Content:
* `DNN-NILM_Publication-List.xlsx` contains the list of the DNN-NILM
  publications that have been reviewed in the mentioned publication. It
  corresponds with minor differences in columns and nomenclature to table 3 in
  the publication and is provided to allow for easy searching and filtering.
  Abbreviations are explained in the publication.
* `Visualize_MAE.ipynb` and `Visualize_F1.ipynb` are the jupyter notebooks that
  have been used to generate the visualizations in the paper, i.e. figures 3
  and 4. 
* `DNN-NILM_low-freq_Performance.xlsx` contains the list of metrics extracted
  from the reviewed publications. Publications that did not report metrics or
  just 'exotic' ones do not appear in the list. The file is the basis for the
  figures generated with the jupyter notebooks. Some explanations on the
  columns can be found in the tab `Explanations`. Please do not expect that
  *all* columns are filled up consistently.
